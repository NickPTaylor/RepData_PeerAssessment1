# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

NOTE: Set working directory to directory containing this file.

## Loading and preprocessing the data

The data is loaded, directly from the zipped file:

```{r}
step.data <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"))
```

A quick check of the data is performed as follows:

```{r}
head(step.data)
dim(step.data)
```
This is consistent with expectations.


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
